Capstone Project - Predicting weekly returns in DXY Index. 

Project Title
The study of this project is the foreign currency (FX) market and specifically the US Dollar Index. The US Dollar Index is a futures contract on what is considered to be the world’s most widely traded currency index for the international value of the US Dollar (ICE US Dollar Index). Note that financial media often refers to this index as the DXY Index (pronounced “Dixie”). Non-US currencies that are part of the DXY are as follows:

Currency	DXY Index
Euro	57.60%
Japanese Yen	13.6%
British Pound	11.9%
Canadian Dollar	9.1%
Swedish Krona	4.2%
Swiss Franc	3.6%
					*see ICE FX Indexes Methodology for details

A research report produced by my employer, Bank of America, examines the FX markets from a quantitative perspective (see ‘BAML FX Quant Primer – FORTE & OCTAVE’). This report was the catalyst for this project. As stated in the report ‘Cross-asset and macroeconomic factors are essential drivers of FX movements…We use cross-asset drivers to produce an optimal currency portfolio. Inputs in our factor model include carry, interest rate trends, rates momentum, and equity momentum’ (see page 2). In this project we will use data for short term US interest rates, short term European interest rates, US equity markets (i.e. S&P 500 Index), and US-Europe interest rate differentials (e.g. the difference between the US and German 3 month interest rates).
